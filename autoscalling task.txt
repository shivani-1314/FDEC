So I am hosting 3 webpages name as home, mobile, laptop.


*STEP 1:FIRST WE NEED TO CREATE 3 DIFFERENT TEMPLATES(to host three different webpages.)

-Launch template name & description as required
-Check : Auto Scaling guidance
-SELECT Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image) AS REQUIRED.
-Instance type : t2.micro
-ENTER KEY PAIR
-Network settings : 1.dont including subnet
                    2.select or create security group
		    3.keep remaing setting default 
		    4.ADD Resource tags :Key and Value as require and chose Resource type : instance

-ADVANCED Setting :
-ENABLE :Detailed CloudWatch monitoring  Info
-ADD user data for 1st template ex:-for home

#!/bin/bash

sudo yum update
sudo yum install httpd-y
sudo echo "<h1> welcome to home page $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemclt enable httpd

2nd template ex:-for mobile

#!/bin/bash

sudo yum update
sudo yum install httpd -y
mkdir /var/www/html/mobile
sudo echo "<h1> welcome to mobile page $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/mobile/index.html
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemclt enable httpd


3rd template ex:-for laptop

#!/bin/bash

sudo yum update
sudo yum install httpd -y
mkdir /var/www/html/laptop
sudo echo "<h1> welcome to laptop page $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/laptop/index.html
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemclt enable httpd
						 
*STEP 2:- CREATE 3 DIFFERENT TARGET GROUPS(to host three different webpages.) 

-SELECT TARGET GROUP OPTION.
-CREATE TARGET GROUPS :-Choose a target type : INSTANCES
-SELECT Target group name : tg-home 
-KEEP DEFAULT PROTOCOL
-Health check protocol : HTTP and  Health check path : /index.html and NEXT 
-Register targets : do not select availability insta 
-SELECT CREATE TARGET GROUPS.
-Follow the same step and create 2 more tg for mobile & laptop also but in health check path for mobile:- /mobile/index.html and for laptop:- /laptop/index.html.			   
						 
	       

*STEP 3: CREATE AN 3 AUTO SCALING GROUPs

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
3. Click on "Auto Scaling Groups" in the navigation pane.
4. Click the "Create Auto Scaling group" button.
5. Select your launch template or configure the details for launching instances, including the instance type, key pair, security group, and IAM role.
6. Set up the network configuration, such as VPC and subnets.
7. Configure advanced options : -SELECT Attach to an existing load balancer
			  	-FROM Choose from your load balancer target groups : SELECT TG1 
			  	-Additional settings
                        	-Monitoring :- ENABLE GROUP METRICS COLLECTION WITHIN CLOUDWATCH 

8.Configure group size and scaling policies :	-Desired capacity : 2
						-Minimum capacity :1
						-Maximum capacity  :5
	        				-Scaling policies
						-optional AND NEXT 
			
9. Review and create the Auto Scaling group.
10.Follow same steps and create 2 more auto scaling groups for mobile and laptop but at time of choose target group for mobile and laptop we choose that tg group that we create for mobile and home.



*STEP 4: CREATE CLOUDWATCH ALARMS

1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudWatch Dashboard.
2. Click on "IN Alarms" in the navigation pane.
3. Click the "Create alarm" button.
4. In the "Create Alarm" wizard, select "Select metric."
5. Choose EC2 -> BY AUTOscalling -> cpuutilization.
6. Configure the conditions for your alarm. Set the threshold value, comparison operator (e.g., Greater than or equal to), and the evaluation period.
7. Under "Actions," select "Add notification action" to receive notifications when the alarm state changes.
8. Configure the notification settings, including the SNS topic to send notifications to.
9. Review and create the alarm.

*STEP 5: TEST AUTO SCALING AND MONITOR EVENTS

1. Take ssh go to terminal and hit streess command so that you can see our setup is properly working or not.
2. install 2 packages using this commands - >sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
					     sudo yum install stress -y
3.using this help command copy one command to give strees :-stress --help
4.Copy stress --cpu 70 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 10s hit this command.

Then go to cloud watch -> in metric -> number to monitor in percentage.
